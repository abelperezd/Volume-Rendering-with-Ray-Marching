# Information from the repository
Lab 3 of the course Advanced Visualization, done in the fourth year.
We have implemented a Volume Rendering algorithm using Ray-Marching. In addition, we can see the result in an application focused on medicine.

The framework has been developed in C++and the Volume Rendering models have been implemented in OpenGL.

In addition to the files, we find an executable in which we can see the result, a report in which we explain in detail the implementation and a [demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_5r5V9TeX4&list=PLB9_8zTTrVjrCGwse6iae4oY9OeJVtho_&index=2).

### Instructions
To see the final result, run the *framework.exe* file.

To see the project in Visual Studio, run the file *visualstudio2015.sln* that we find inside the folder *visualstudio15*.

The project has been done on the basis of a framework developed by [Javi Agenjo](https://github.com/jagenjo).
